The purpose of the project is to create a machine learning program for finding the factors of lung cancer and predicting how it affects patients and finally detecting the level of lung cancer of the given patient. Data is pre-processed in order to apply certain operations to it. We started by analyzing which of the conditions given in the dataset affect the cancer level. After we determined those conditions, we predicted the level of cancer for a given patient through the machine learning model we created.
